        <h1><span class="maroonColor"> Unwind by Neil Shusterman summary</h1></span>
Unwind is a dystopian novel by Neal Shusterman. It takes place in the United States in the near future. After the Second Civil War ("The Heartland War") was fought over abortion, a compromise was reached, allowing parents to sign an order for their children between the ages of 13 and 18 to be "unwound" â€” taken to "harvest camps" and dissected into their body parts for later use. The reasoning is that since 99.44% of the body is used, unwinds do not technically die because their individual body parts live on.
